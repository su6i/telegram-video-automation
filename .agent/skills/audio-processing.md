# Skill: Audio Processing (Technical Encyclopedia)

[Back to README](../../README.md)

Comprehensive technical protocols for the acquisition, processing, and mastering of audio in the 2025 ecosystem. This document defines the standards for loudness normalization (LUFS), spectral signal repair, and high-fidelity signal orchestration.

---

## 1. Loudness Normalization Standards (LUFS / LKFS)
The industrial standard for consistent perceived volume across diverse platforms (YouTube, Spotify, Netflix).

### 1.1 BS.1770-4 Protocols
*   **Integrated Loudness:** Target for the entire track (Standard: -14 LUFS for YouTube, -16 LUFS for Podcast).
*   **True Peak (dBTP):** Maximum peak measured through inter-sample interpolation. Standard: < -1.0 dBTP to prevent clipping during lossy conversion (AAC/MP3).
*   **Loudness Range (LRA):** Measurement of the dynamic variety within a program.

### 1.2 Implementation Protocol (FFmpeg / Python)
```python
# 1.2.1 LUFS Analysis Logic
# Utilizing the 'loudnorm' filter for automatic matching to target.
ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11:print_format=json -f null -
```

## 2. Spectral Analysis & Signal Repair
Identifying and eliminating spectral artifacts using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).

### 2.1 Spectral Repair Protocols
*   **De-Noising:** Utilizing spectral subtraction or AI-based models (e.g., Clear, iZotope RX) to separate signal from environmental noise.
*   **Mouth De-Clicking:** Visual identification of high-frequency transients unrelated to phonemes.
*   **Harmonic Reconstruction:** Synthesizing missing frequency bands when processing low-bitrate source material.

---

## 3. Dynamic Range Management
Controlling the bridge between the quietest and loudest parts of the signal.

### 3.1 Compression Logic & Parameters
*   **Threshold:** The level above which the signal is attenuated.
*   **Ratio:** The amount of attenuation applied (Standard: 3:1 for voice, 4:1 for aggressive control).
*   **Attack & Release:** 
    *   **Attack:** Velocity of response (Fast for transients, slow for transparency).
    *   **Release:** Velocity of recovery (Must be timed to prevent "pumping" artifacts).

### 3.2 Multiband Compression Standard
Processing specific frequency ranges (Low, Mid, High) independently to fix tonal imbalances without affecting the entire signal.

## 4. Technical Appendix: Comprehensive Audio Metric Reference
| Metric | Full Name | Standard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LUFS** | Loudness Units relative to Full Scale | -14 to -16 |
| **dBTP** | Decibels True Peak | < -1.0 |
| **RMS** | Root Mean Square (Avg Power) | Variable |
| **THD** | Total Harmonic Distortion | < 0.1% |
| **Crest Factor** | Ratio of Peak to RMS | > 12dB (Good) |

## 5. Industrial Case Study: AI Dubbing Signal Path
**Objective:** Processing a raw multilingual recording for high-resolution distribution.
1.  **De-Verb:** Removing room reflections to simulate a dry studio environment.
2.  **Spectral Matching:** Aligning the EQ curve of the AI-generated voice to match the human original.
3.  **Phase Alignment:** Correcting micro-delays between multiple microphones to prevent comb filtering.
4.  **Brickwall Limiting:** Ensuring strict compliance with the -1.0 dBTP ceiling while maintaining constant -14 LUFS.

---

## 6. Glossary of Audio Processing Terms
*   **Sample Rate:** Number of snapshots taken per second (Standard: 48kHz for video, 44.1kHz for music).
*   **Bit Depth:** Number of bits used to represent each sample (Standard: 24-bit for recording, 32-bit float for processing).
*   **Dithering:** Adding low-level noise to mask quantization errors when reducing bit depth (e.g., 24 to 16-bit).
*   **Phase Inversion:** Flipping the polarity of a signal; used extensively for noise cancellation and phase checking.

---

## 7. Mathematical Foundations: The Fourier Transform
*   **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT):** The mathematical process of converting a signal from the Time Domain (waveform) to the Frequency Domain (spectrum).
*   **Zero-Crossing:** The point where a waveform crosses the zero-amplitude line; the ideal point for splicing audio to avoid "clicks."

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Quality Verification (The "Red Book")
*   **Aliasing:** High-frequency artifacts occurring when the signal exceeds the Nyquist frequency. *Fix: Use steep anti-aliasing filters.*
*   **DC Offset:** An electrical or digital displacement of the zero-axis. *Fix: Apply a high-pass filter at 20Hz.*
*   **Jitter:** Timing variations in the sample clock during A/D conversion.

---

## 9. Appendix: Surround and Object-Based Audio
*   **5.1 / 7.1 Mapping:** Traditional multi-channel standards.
*   **Dolby Atmos / ADM:** Metadata-driven spatial audio where sounds are "objects" placed in 3D space rather than assigned to specific speakers.

---

## 10. Benchmarks & Scaling Standards (2025)
*   **Processing Latency:** Target < 10ms for real-time monitoring.
*   **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** Target > 90dB for studio-grade recordings.
*   **THD+N:** Targeted to remain below 0.005% throughout the signal chain.
