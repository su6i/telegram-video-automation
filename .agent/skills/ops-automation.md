# Skill: Ops Automation (Technical Encyclopedia)

[Back to README](../../README.md)

Comprehensive technical protocols for the design and orchestration of autonomous system operations in the 2025 ecosystem. This document defines the standards for self-healing infrastructure, deterministic backup verification, and automated health-check orchestration.

---

## 1. Self-Healing Infrastructure Protocols
Building systems that detect and resolve failures without human intervention.

### 1.1 Watchdog & Health-Check Patterns
*   **The Liveness Probe:** Technical logic to determine if a process is still running.
*   **The Readiness Probe:** Determining if a process is capable of handling incoming traffic.
*   **Auto-Restart Logic:** Programmatic triggering of service restarts (via `systemctl` or `kubectl`) when a specific "Failure Counter" threshold is exceeded.

### 1.2 Automated Remediation Workflows
```bash
# 1.2.1 Example: Automated Disk Cleanup
# A script triggered by a "Disk Space > 90%" alert.
find /var/log -type f -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -exec rm -f {} \;
```

---

## 2. Deterministic Backup & Disaster Recovery
Standardizing the safety of data through automated verification.

### 2.1 Backup Integrity Protocols
*   **The "Cold Test":** Automated restoration of a random backup to a sandboxed environment every 24 hours.
*   **Checksum Verification:** Generating and storing SHA-256 hashes for every backup volume to detect bit-rot or corruption.

### 2.2 Off-site Synchronization Standard
Utilizing `rclone` or `rsync` with `--checksum` and `--immutable` flags to ensure that backups are mirrored to geographically distant object storage (S3/GCS) with zero risk of override.

---

## 3. High-Performance Monitoring & Alerting
Moving from "Reactive" to "Proactive" observability.

### 3.1 Log Aggregation Standards
*   **The ELK/PLG Stack:** Centralizing logs from all nodes into a unified queryable database.
*   **Structured Logging:** Mandatory use of JSON for all system logs to enable automated parsing and alerting (e.g., using `jq` or `grafana`).

### 3.2 Alert Fatigue Mitigation
*   **Logic:** Utilizing "Inhibitor Rules" to prevent a single failure from triggering a cascade of redundant alerts.
*   **Severity Mapping:** Only P0 (System Down) alerts trigger active notification; P1-P3 (Warnings) are logged for weekly review.

| Module | Technical Implementation | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backups** | `borgbackup` / `restic` | Dedup + Encrypt |
| **Monit.** | `prometheus` + `node_exporter`| Metrics |
| **Remed.** | `ansible` / `saltstack` | Automation |
| **Self-Heal**| `monit` / `supervisord` | Watchdog |

## 5. Industrial Case Study: Autonomous Database Cluster
**Objective:** Managing a PostgreSQL cluster with 99.99% uptime.
1.  **Replica Synchronization:** Automated monitoring of replication lag.
2.  **Failover:** Using `patroni` to automatically promote a follower to leader if the primary node fails.
3.  **Point-in-Time Recovery:** Automated nightly EBS snapshots + WAL-G streaming to S3.
4.  **Verification:** A weekly "Drill" where the primary node is intentionally killed to verify that the self-healing logic correctly executes the failover.

---

## 6. Glossary of Ops Automation Terms
*   **Downtime:** The period during which a system is unavailable for use.
*   **SLO (Service Level Objective):** A technical target for system performance (e.g., "95% of requests < 100ms").
*   **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering):** The discipline of applying software engineering principles to operations.
*   **Redundancy:** The inclusion of extra components that are not strictly necessary to functioning, in case of failure of other components.

---

## 7. Mathematical Foundations: Reliability Math
*   **Availability Formula:** $A = \frac{\text{MTBF}}{\text{MTBF} + \text{MTTR}}$, where MTBF is Mean Time Between Failures and MTTR is Mean Time To Repair.
*   **Optimization:** In 2025, Ops Automation focuses on minimizing MTTR via automated detection and restart.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Performance Verification
*   **Stale Backups:** Failure detection for `cron` jobs that stop running. *Fix: Use "Dead-man's Switch" monitoring (e.g., Healthchecks.io).*
*   **False Positives:** Alerts triggering during scheduled maintenance. *Fix: Use "Maintenance Windows" or "Silence" periods in the monitoring tool.*

---

## 9. Appendix: Future "AI-Ops" Trends
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis:** Utilizing anomaly detection algorithms to predict hardware failures hours before they occur based on micro-fluctuations in CPU voltage or disk latency.

---

## 10. Benchmarks & Performance Standards (2025)
*   **Detection Time:** Target < 10s for critical system failure.
*   **Restoration Time:** Target < 5m for full service recovery from a node failure.
