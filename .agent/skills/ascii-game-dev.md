# Skill: ASCII Game Development (Technical Encyclopedia)

[Back to README](../../README.md)

Comprehensive technical protocols for the design, architecture, and rendering of games within a text-based terminal environment in the 2025 ecosystem. This document defines the standards for double-buffered terminal rendering, Entity-Component System (ECS) architectures, and Ray-casting for 2.5D environments.

---

## 1. Terminal Rendering Engineering
Standardizing on the most performant methods for character-based graphics.

### 1.1 Double-Buffering Protocol
*   **Logic:** Utilizing two character arrays (Back Buffer and Front Buffer) to calculate the "Difference" between frames, only sending changed characters to the terminal via ANSI escape codes to minimize flickering.
*   **Cursor Management:** Mandatory use of `\033[H` (Home) and `\033[?25l` (Hide Cursor) to stabilize the visual output.

### 1.2 Implementation Protocol (Python Rendering)
```python
# 1.2.1 Frame Delta Calculation
def render_frame(prev_buffer, current_buffer):
    for y in range(HEIGHT):
        for x in range(WIDTH):
            if current_buffer[y][x] != prev_buffer[y][x]:
                move_cursor(x, y)
                print(current_buffer[y][x], end="")
```

## 2. Entity-Component System (ECS) for CLI Games
Structuring game logic for high-extensibility and performance.

### 2.1 ECS Components
*   **Entity:** A unique ID representing a game object (Player, Bullet, Wall).
*   **Component:** Raw data containers (e.g., `Position`, `Velocity`, `Renderable`).
*   **System:** Functional logic that operates on entities with specific components (e.g., `MovementSystem` updates `Position` using `Velocity`).

### 2.2 System Orchestration Standard
Running systems in a deterministic order (Input -> Logic -> Physics -> Render) to avoid frame-lag or state inconsistencies.

---

## 3. Advanced ASCII Physics & Geometry
Implementing traditional game math in a discretized coordinate system.

### 3.1 ANSI Collision Math
*   **The Grid Constraint:** Collision checks occur on integer coordinates.
*   **Logic:** Utilizing "AABB" (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) logic adapted for the 1:2 character aspect ratio (characters are taller than they are wide).

### 3.2 2.5D Ray-Casting (Doom-style)
Utilizing trigonometric functions to project a 2D map into a pseudo-3D view using different characters (e.g., `#`, `M`, `.`) to represent depth/distance (The "Character Dithering" Protocol).

## 4. Technical Appendix: ASCII Game Reference
| Aspect | Technical Implementation | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input** | Non-blocking raw mode | Responsiveness |
| **Color** | 256-color / TrueColor | Aesthetics |
| **Animation**| Character cycling | Fluidity |
| **Sound** | PC-Speaker / WAV via API | Immersion |

## 5. Industrial Case Study: The "Cyberpunk CLI" RPG
**Objective:** Building a fast-paced game with 60fps terminal updates.
1.  **Rendering:** Using a `C` extension to handle the 10,000 character buffer updates.
2.  **Logic:** An ECS-driven engine handles 500+ active NPCs.
3.  **Audio:** Integrating `pygame.mixer` for positional 2D sound.
4.  **Verification:** Automated benchmark testing shows < 2% CPU usage on modern M3 hardware.

---

## 6. Glossary of ASCII Game Terms
*   **TUI (Text User Interface):** The broader category of terminal applications.
*   **Frame-rate:** The frequency at which the terminal buffer is cleared and redrawn.
*   **Dithering:** Using character density to simulate grayscale or color gradients.
*   **ANSI Escape Sequence:** Standardized codes used to control color and cursor position in terminals.

---

## 7. Mathematical Foundations: Ray-Caster Distance
*   **Formula:** $d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$.
*   **Implementation:** In 2025, ASCII ray-casters use the "Fish-eye Correction" math ($\text{CorrectedDist} = d \cdot \cos(\theta)$) to ensure walls appear straight and not curved.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Performance Verification
*   **Flickering:** Occurs when the entire screen is cleared (`clear`) every frame. *Fix: Mandatory double-buffering or incremental updates.*
*   **Laggy Input:** Input buffer backing up. *Fix: Use a dedicated "Input Thread" with non-blocking reads.*

---

## 9. Appendix: Future "Terminal" Standards
*   **GPU-Accelerated Terminals (Kitty/Alacritty):** Leveraging specialized protocols (e.g., the Kitty Graphics Protocol) to display high-resolution PNGs alongside ASCII characters for "Hybrid" game environments.

---

## 10. Benchmarks & Performance Standards (2025)
*   **Input Latency:** Target < 1 frame (16ms @ 60fps).
*   **Buffer Fill:** Target 100% 4K terminal characters in < 5ms.
