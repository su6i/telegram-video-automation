# Skill: Financial Data Science (Technical Encyclopedia)

[Back to README](../../README.md)

Comprehensive technical protocols for the analysis of financial markets, strategy backtesting, and quantitative risk management in the 2025 ecosystem. This document defines the standards for multi-source data acquisition (OpenBB), high-performance vector-based backtesting (VectorBT), and institutional-grade risk modeling.

## 1. Unified Market Data Architecture (OpenBB v4 SDK)
Standardizing data ingestion from fragmented global providers into a single, type-safe Python API.

### 1.1 Provider Mapping & Data Normalization
*   **OpenBB Platform:** v4 uses a provider-agnostic interface where symbols (tickers) and parameters are mapped to internal standardized schemas.
*   **Supported Assets:** Programmatic access to Equities, Options, Crypto, Forex, Fixed Income, and Macroeconomic indicators (FRED/SEC/OECD).
*   **Data Integrity:** Automatic verification of OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data against multiple sources to detect "bad prints" or missing ticks.

### 1.2 Ingestion Protocols for 2025
```python
from openbb import obp

# 1.2.1 Mandatory Standardization Standard
# Fetching historical daily data with multi-provider fallback logic.
data = obp.equity.price.historical(
    symbol="AAPL", 
    provider="fmp", # Primary source: Financial Modeling Prep
    start_date="2020-01-01",
    interval="1d"
).to_df()

# 1.2.2 Real-time LOB (Limit Order Book) Streaming
# Protocols for mapping L2 (Level 2) data into bid/ask imbalance features.
```

## 2. High-Performance Backtesting (VectorBT Pro)
Utilizing NumPy, Numba JIT, and Pandas for ultra-fast, vectorized strategy simulation.

### 2.1 Vectorization vs. Event-Driven Logic
*   **Event-Driven:** Iterating through time steps one-by-one ($O(T)$). Slow and prone to Python loop overhead.
*   **Vectorized (VectorBT):** Treating the entire price series as a single multidimensional array and performing matrix operations ($O(1)$ effectively). This allows the simulation of millions of trades in milliseconds.

### 2.2 Numba JIT Optimization Standards
*   **`@njit` (No Python Mode):** Mandatory for custom signal generation and complex portfolio logic. It compiles Python functions into machine code, bypassing the GIL.
*   **Memory Layout:** Using C-contiguous or F-contiguous arrays to maximize CPU cache performance.

### 2.3 Advanced Implementation Logic
```python
import vectorbtpro as vbt
import numpy as np

# 2.3.1 Vectorized RSI Signal Generation
rsi = vbt.RSI.run(data['close'], window=14)
entries = rsi.rsi_below(30) # Oversold (Buy)
exits = rsi.rsi_above(70)   # Overbought (Sell)

# 2.3.2 Quantitative Portfolio Simulation
pf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(
    data['close'], 
    entries, 
    exits, 
    fees=0.001, # 0.1% Commission
    slippage=0.0005, # Adaptive Slippage
    init_cash=10000
)
print(pf.stats())
```

## 3. Technical Alpha & Feature Engineering
Generating predictive "Alpha" signals from raw market and alternative data sources.

### 3.1 2025 SOTA Indicators & Signal Math
*   **VPIN (Volume-Synchronized Probability of Informed Trading):** Measuring order flow toxicity by monitoring volume-bucketed trade imbalances.
*   **Microstructure Features:** Analyzing bid-ask spread expansion, trade size distribution (Block trades), and "Order-Flow Imbalance" (OFI).
*   **Sentiment Fusion:** Integrating VADER or BERT-based sentiment scores from social media and news feeds as weighting factors.

### 3.2 Feature Scaling and Stationary Checks
*   **Stationarity:** Applying ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) tests to ensure data doesn't have a trend before feeding into ML models.
*   **Fractional Differentiation:** Preserving "memory" in price data while achieving stationarity (standard alternative to simple differencing).

---

## 4. Institutional-Grade Risk Management
Ensuring portfolio survivability through rigorous stress testing and statistical constraints.

### 4.1 Quantitative Risk Metrics
*   **Value at Risk (VaR):** Protocols for calculating 1-day 99% VaR using Monte Carlo simulation (10,000+ paths).
*   **Conditional VaR (CVaR/Expected Shortfall):** Measuring the average loss in the extreme 1% tail of the distribution.
*   **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** The largest peak-to-trough decline in the account's value.

### 4.2 Black Swan Stress Testing
*   **Historical Scenarios:** Replaying the strategy during 2008 GFC, 2020 COVID Flash Crash, and 2024 VIX Spikes.
*   **Synthetic Scenarios:** Generating high-volatility GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion) paths with leptokurtic (fat) tails to test policy resilience.

---

## 5. Machine Learning for Quant Finance (MLOps)
*   **Meta-Labeling:** Training a secondary "binary filter" model to predict the probability of a primary signal's success (improves win rate).
*   **Cross-Validation:** Utilizing "Purged and Embargoed" K-Fold cross-validation to prevent information leakage across time.
*   **Feature Importance:** Using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to clarify why a specific trade was triggered.

---

## 6. Execution & Order Management Logic
*   **FIX / binary Protocols:** Standard for high-speed connectivity to exchanges (e.g., Interactive Brokers TWS API).
*   **VWAP / TWAP Execution:** Algorithms to split large orders into smaller chunks to minimize "Market Impact" (slippage).
*   **Latency Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of the "Tick-to-Trade" loop to ensure sub-millisecond responsiveness.

---

## 7. Benchmarks & Performance Indicators (2025)
*   **Backtest Throughput:** 1M ticks processed in < 2 seconds (VectorBT + Numba).
*   **Portfolio Sharpe:** Target > 1.5 for professional-grade intraday strategies.
*   **Trading Costs:** Modeled at < 5 bps (basis points) for high-liquidity assets.
