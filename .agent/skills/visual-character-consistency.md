# Skill: Visual Character Consistency (Technical Encyclopedia)



Comprehensive technical protocols for the maintenance of visual stability for digital characters across diverse scenes, poses, and lighting conditions in the 2025 ecosystem. This document defines the standards for IP-Adapter FaceID, InstantID node logic, and specialized LoRA training for character persistence.

---

## 1. Character Persistence Architectures (2025)
Moving beyond "Seed" luck to deterministic character control.

### 1.1 IP-Adapter FaceID Standard
*   **Logic:** Utilizing a specialized image-prompting adapter that focuses specifically on high-frequency facial features while allowing the rest of the image to be governed by the text prompt.
*   **FACEIDV2:** The latest iteration utilizing LoRA-based identity projections for near-perfect likeness (95%+ match).

### 1.2 InstantID Implementation Protocol (ComfyUI)
*   **ControlNet Integration:** Combining identity embeddings with facial landmark ControlNets (Canny/Keypoints) to ensure the character's face matches the intended pose.
*   **InsightFace Backend:** Utilizing the industrial-standard 2D/3D face analysis library to extract identity vectors.

---

## 2. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for Characters
The "Gold Standard" for high-resolution, multi-contextual character persistence.

### 2.1 Training Protocol: Dataset Standards
*   **Quantity:** 50-100 high-resolution images.
*   **Diversity:** Must include:
    *   **Close-ups:** For extreme facial detail.
    *   **Full-body:** For clothing and proportional consistency.
    *   **Variable Lighting:** Studio lights, Golden hour, Candlelight.
    *   **Different Poses:** Sitting, Running, Talking.

### 2.2 Hyperparameter Benchmarks
*   **Learning Rate:** $1e-4$ to $5e-5$.
*   **Rank (Network Rank):** 64-128 (Higher rank = more capacity, but higher risk of over-fitting).
*   **Alpha:** Equal to Rank for balanced stability.

---

## 3. Temporal Consistency for Characters (AI Video)
Maintaining identity across 24fps video sequences.

### 3.1 Initial Frame Anchoring
*   **Logic:** Generating a high-fidelity 4K portrait as the "Anchor," then using image-to-video with high **Character Strength** settings.
*   **Face-Fixing:** Utilizing Face-Swap-Lab or Reactor nodes on post-production to "Glue" the target likeness onto the generated video.

## 4. Technical Appendix: Character Consistency Reference
| Tool | Technical Implementation | Persistence Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **InstantID** | Identity + Structure Maps | Extreme (Likeness) |
| **IP-Adapter** | Feature Injection | High (Visual Style) |
| **LoRA** | Weights Fine-tuning | Permanent (Library) |
| **ControlNet** | Pose Constraint | Structure Only |

## 5. Industrial Case Study: The "Automated Spokesperson"
**Objective:** Creating 100 educational videos featuring the same AI character.
1.  **Base Training:** Train a Flux/SDXL LoRA specifically on the target character.
2.  **Scene Mapping:** The orchestrator defines the character's pose in each scene using ControlNets.
3.  **Batch Generation:** Generating frames where the character appears in a library, a lab, and a garden while maintaining identical facial structure.
4.  **Verification:** Using a secondary "Similarity Agent" (Face-Rec) to verify that the likeness score remains > 0.9 across all frames.

---

## 6. Glossary of Visual Consistency Terms
*   **Likeness:** The degree of similarity between the generated image and the reference person.
*   **Over-fitting:** When a LoRA is too rigid, forcing the character into the same pose or lighting regardless of the prompt.
*   **Identity Vector:** A mathematical representation of a person's facial features extracted by a model like InsightFace.
*   **Token Trigger:** The specific keyword (e.g., `SKS_CHARACTER`) used to activate the LoRA weights during generation.

---

## 7. Mathematical Foundations: Euclidean Distance in Identity Space
*   **Face Recognition Math:** Vectors $v1, v2 \dots$ represent the identity. The "Distance" $d(v1, v2)$ tells us if it's the same person.
*   **Optimizer Algorithms (AdamW):** The math used during LoRA training to adjust weights to minimize the difference between the target likeness and the noise prediction.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Performance Verification
*   **Character Bloat:** The character starts to look like a generic AI face over time. *Fix: Increase the weight of the FaceID adapter.*
*   **Color Bleeding:** The character's clothing color leaks into the background. *Fix: Use "Attention Masking" or "Breaking the Prompt" techniques.*

---

## 9. Appendix: Future "Personal Studio" Trends
*   **Zero-Shot Consistency:** Models that can maintain character identity perfectly with only 1 reference image and no fine-tuning.

---

## 10. Benchmarks & Performance Standards (2025)
*   **Identity Score:** Target > 0.92 on the FaceNet scale.
*   **Context Versatility:** Character should be able to appear in > 10 distinct environments with 100% recognition.
